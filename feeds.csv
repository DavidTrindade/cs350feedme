The bicycle is more than a thing, it's an issue. The Paceline also discusses the bike's place in society. The hosts love bike gear so expect some banter about what works and what does not on the road and trail. The show is backed by the Fatcyclist and Red Kite Prayer. The podcast on two wheels. No training wheels needed.  The Paceline is hosted by Selene ""the fit chick"" Yeager and Patrick Brady, and is a production by Red Kite Prayer."

http://feeds.feedburner.com/PrimeTimeMoney	Part-Time Money®	This podcast is intended for everyone who wants more information about making extra money. Specifically, making money in a part-time business, making money on the side outside of your normal job. I will present simple ideas for you to bring in some extra income. Whether you need to pay off some extra debts that you have or you want to raise money for savings, I'm here to help. I took a survey on my blog recently. The number one problem people said they were having was not enough income, and they wanted more content from me on how to make more income. I know how to blog. I know how to do some affiliate marketing. But, as far as any other businesses out there, I am not a pro, so my solution to that answer was to bring in some other people and to conduct interviews over a podcast format with people who are doing part-time gigs or who have created side businesses that are now successful to bring in extra money. I hope you will stay tuned regardless of the topic because hopefully there are some business principles that apply across whatever type of making money idea you have, and so hopefully there will be some information for everyone in each podcast.

I am still the person I was a minute ago before I told you. (Nervous Comics)Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: illustrating my experience


How can I help?

The aim of the Time to Change campaign is to encourage us all to be more about our mental health, and to start conversations with those who might need our support.

Why not find out how you could start a conversation about mental health?

You could share a blog story to raise awareness. You could sign up to receive Time to Change emails. And, you might want to add your name to our pledge wall, joining the thousands of people who are taking small steps to be more open about mental health.

Personal blogs about living with post traumatic stress disorder

Founded in Detroit in 1954 by Edgar P. Richardson, then Director of the Detroit Institute of Arts, and Lawrence A. Fleischman, a Detroit executive and active young collector, the initial goal of the Archives was to serve as microfilm repository of papers housed in other institutions. This mission expanded quickly to collecting and preserving original material and in 1970, the Archives joined the Smithsonian Institution, sharing their mandate: the increase and diffusion of knowledge.

http://www.singlemothersurvivalguide.com/feed	Single Mother Survival Guide	"Becoming a single mum is one of the most daunting and overwhelming life changes someone will ever go through. Whether you are pregnant or have teenagers, you will most likely be confused and struggling with what to do next. I became a single mum in 2013 when my daughter was just a few months old, and it has been a challenging but rewarding journey ever since. This Podcast (and the website www.singlemothersurvivalguide) was created to assist newly single mothers in all things they may need to know about.<br />
<br />
SO WHAT IS THE SINGLE MOTHER SURVIVAL GUIDE PODCAST ABOUT?<br />
<br />
A Podcast for single mums, made by a single mum… The Single Mother Survival Guide Podcast includes a mixture of me babbling about single mums business and interviews and discussions with different people and experts about different topics.<br />
<br />
First off the ranks this includes an interview with a Wills and Estate lawyer which contains everything YOU need to know about getting a Will done, an interview with a financial adviser on everyday money management, savings, spending and so forth, an interview with an online security expert so that YOU know how to keep yourself secure online, an open interview with a domestic violence survivor and advocate, and another interview with a financial adviser on everything to do with insurance, and what you should think about getting insured to ensure the financial safety for you and your kids. Coming up after that I have chats with people including parenting experts, family lawyers, and a life coach.<br />
<br />
I also chat about the social stigma of being a single mum, single parent travel, everyday tips to make YOUR life easier, dating, personal budgeting, resources out there to help YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN, child support, domestic violence, successful co-parenting, advantages to being a single mum, and the list goes on…"

From achieving your goals, preparing a memorable meal, creating a capsule wardrobe, traveling the world (Francophiles tune in as Paris is a favorite destination), and living life to the fullest without breaking the bank, living well is really quite simple.

https://www.relaxedmale.com/category/mens-health/feed	Mens Health – The Relaxed Male	Helping men find their purpose and why by changing the mindset that holds them back. I want men to change the relationship they have with themselves. Men, it is possible to change the mindset that is often associated with the anxiety and burn out that leaves you as an emotionless shell. I want to show men that they can pursue their dreams and bring their family along. They don't have to choose as society wants them to believe. We need men who are strong and determined leaders. I want to show men that they have choices and by setting goals and taking action they can achieve their dreams.

http://andreamorrison.co.uk/feed	andreamorrison.co.uk	"Do you catch yourself thinking ‘there must be another way’? Are you fed up with life & business feeling so hard, where everything seems to be such a challenge? Are you sick of being constrained by the beliefs you have about yourself or what others may believe of you? Are you equally tired of outdated definitions of success, tired of being told you need to be more, have more?<br />
And do you feel that you have tried EVERYTHING to simply be happy and content, to really feel that you re enough?<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Business Revolution Podcast, with me, Andrea Morrison. <br />
<br />
Listen in to discover what really lies behind reaching your innate potential, where I explore a simply, yet impactful, understanding (also known as the The Three Principles) that revolutionises these outdated ideas, beliefs and experiences. <br />
<br />
Imagine the impact it would have on your life, your business, your work if you knew as a truth you had everything that you needed already within you and that being completely YOU was the key to your success.<br />
<br />
The impact on your life and business by feeling innately confident, creative, resilient, happy and calm - in fact all the things that you seek - you already have - it’s just in this moment, you don’t think you do.<br />
<br />
The impact of knowing how you can let go of stress, fear, worry and self doubt leaving you knowing that you can access your innate confidence, happiness, resilience, creativity and by freeing your mind you free your innate potential to enable you to create a business and life that you really love.<br />
<br />
If you've enjoyed this podcast, please rate and review and also feel free to continue the conversation in my FREE Facebook community The Business Revolution."

https://www.diamond-consultants.com/feed	Diamond Consultants: Financial Advisor Recruiting Firm	"As a nationally recognized recruiter and consultant to financial advisors, Mindy Diamond has unmatched experience in introducing advisors to the independent space—an option that has greatly expanded yet remains somewhat of a mystery to many advisors. <br />
Her goal in this podcast for financial advisors is to dispel some myths, share some facts and help advisors get better educated on the model without any concern over confidentiality or obligation. She offers comparisons between different types of independent models from Independent Broker Dealers (IBD) to Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) and Hybrid RIAs, and much more. <br />
Episodes include conversations with industry leaders and breakaway advisors who left the captive employee wealth management world for one where they could grow their financial advisory business in a way that aligned with their own goals. Be sure to subscribe and stay up to date.<br />
Diamond offers additional information for advisors who are looking to increase their knowledge of the independent space, as well as traditional models for advisors in wealth management. Visit https://www.diamond-consultants.com/podcast-mindy-diamond-independence/"

http://redkiteprayer.com/?feed=rss2	RKP	"The Paceline is a cycling podcast aimed at roadies, mountain bikers, commuters, cyclocross enthusiasts , those who grind gravel—indeed anyone who claims cycling for their own. The bicycle is more than a thing, it's an issue. The Paceline also discusses the bike's place in society. The hosts love bike gear so expect some banter about what works and what does not on the road and trail. The show is backed by the Fatcyclist and Red Kite Prayer. The podcast on two wheels. No training wheels needed.  The Paceline is hosted by Selene ""the fit chick"" Yeager and Patrick Brady, and is a production by Red Kite Prayer."

In 2014, at a time when most of the media were throwing themselves fully into becoming click-based advertising platforms, we launched a print magazine for the first digitally-native generation of readers. <br />
The podcast builds on that - we are talking with founders about their early days, the painful experiences on their way to success.  Some of our guests have built unicorns, others are only at the beginning of their careers as entrepreneurs. <br />
As the name suggests, CoFounder is about creating something new together. We use the classical foundation of good journalistic practice, but we are building something new: a medium for startups, a platform where startup communities can co-operate."

Since then, the boys have come a very long way: from a best-selling book to sold out live shows.


Now, with the return of football post-lockdown, the Football Ramble brings you daily episodes of equal parts insight and hilarity. All this and more, Monday through Friday. Lend us your ears and we’ll keep you up to date with the latest stories from the Premier League and all around Europe, all with an eye for both the sublime and the ridiculous."

https://feeds.megaphone.fm/unlocking-us	Unlocking Us with Brené Brown	I’ve spent over 20 years studying the emotions and experiences that bring meaning and purpose to our lives, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s this: We are hardwired for connection, and connecting requires courage, vulnerability, and conversation. I want this to be a podcast that’s real, unpolished, honest, and reflects both the magic and the messiness of what it means to be human. Episodes will include conversations with the people who are teaching me, challenging me, confusing me, or maybe even ticking me off a little. I'll also have direct conversations with you about what I’m learning from new research, and we'll do some episodes dedicated to answering your questions. We don’t have to do life alone. We were never meant to.

http://feeds.harvardbusiness.org/harvardbusiness/the-anxious-achiever	The Anxious Achiever	"Host Morra Aarons-Mele is on a mission to reframe how we think about anxiety and mental health in the workplace. Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S. We desperately need better models for leadership and a more holistic view of mental health. Our culture tells those of us who suffer from anxiety and depression that we can’t succeed but we tell a different story — without sugarcoating the tough stuff. We feature stories from people who’ve been there and experts who can help you thrive.

The views expressed on this podcast are those of its hosts, guests, and callers, and not those of Harvard Business Review."

Hypnosis is an alternative medicine that can used for a wide range of issues, categorized under Illness (Mild Depression, Pain Management, Teeth Grinding); Daily Issues (Insomnia, Weight Loss, Phobia, Anxiety, Anger Management); Break Habits (Stop Smoking, Nail Biting, Quit Alcohol); Improve Performance (Sports management, Focus, Improve Concentration, Improve Memory). It is effective as can be seen here: ""In 1970, a research conducted by Alfred Barrios found that hypnotherapy had a massive 93% success rate after only 6 sessions compared to only a 72% success rate with behavioral therapy (after 22 sessions on average), and only 38% success rate with psychotherapy (after an average of 600 sessions)."""

"<p>Welcome to the blog of Chris Cole, life coach at Cole Coaching, where life coaching is offered to individuals in recovery from any number of addiction, mood, or behavioral issues. Chris is also the author of <em>The Body of Chris: A Memoir of Obsession, Addiction, and Madness</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris himself lives with bipolar disorder and enjoys years of substance-free living. He's been sober and clean since 2007. He also considers himself in recovery from disordered eating. His knowledge of spirituality, spiritual emergence, and spiritual emergency allow him to speak to and address the great ambiguity between altered states of consciousness through spiritual awakening versus those caused by mental illness. His education in humanistic and transpersonal psychology provides a framework for his understanding.</p>
<p>Chris Cole is able to work with individuals, their parents or family members, and alongside clinical direction.</p>"

http://ovrld.com/feed	Ovrld	The purpose of this podcast is to shine a light on weird culture all around Austin, from poetry to fashion to comedy to music (we do, however, have a soft spot for Texas hip hop). Normally JRo outta #LeagueDJz spins and breaks tracks from Texas musicians and in the meantime, he and Protextor sit down and chop it up over Lone Star Beers with a different guest each week but this week Morgan fills in for Jro. The result is a casual hang with real people doing cool shit in ATX. It’s not radio and it’s not an interview — it’s a hot conversation. This week N∆TE drops in to talk about producers who also direct, artisanal weed strains, recording in unusual spaces and more.

http://www.getupandgoguru.com/cfs-me-blog/feed	The Get Up And Go Guru	Louise Bibby, CFS / ME Coach, reads out her written blogs (from www.GetUpAndGoGuru.com) so that people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME ) (CFIDS), fibromyalgia and other chronic illnesses who spend a lot of time in bed are able to listen to her blog rather than reading it. There is a small introduction of the blog at the start of every episode, with a little bit of chat before Louise reads the written blog aloud. Her blogs are about living powerfully with CFS / ME / CFIDS, illness management, and the ups and downs of life with chronic illness. The Get Up And Go Guru is also about empowering people with CFS / ME / FM & other Spoonies to continue to live their passions and purpose via online means. Stay tuned for a new podcast where Louise will interview Spoonies who are doing just that!

https://www.throughtheeyesofdepression.org/feed	Mental Health Awareness Is Essential	"The goal of WIN OVER DEPRESSION is to spread awareness about the Mental Health epidemic and provide insight, and understanding about the daily challenges individuals with mental health issues. It can be hard to get out of bed in the morning or feel motivated to interact with others.  Quite often it feels as though a dark cloud is hovering over you.  During the most painful times you just feel ALONE.The clinically depressed individual struggles daily to survive. The mind is the worst enemy they have and they are often trapped inside their thoughts. They make assumptions about their interactions, sometimes become paranoid and have difficulty decided what is true. They feel alone in their pain because they are convinced they are a burden to their family and friends. They have a couple of friends in whom they may confide, but unless you have experienced the deep-rooted sadness and helplessness no one  can really understand the day to day and often moment to moment struggle of mental health disorders. For the most part, sufferers of mental health conditions conceal the fact they suffer with clinical depression because society can be cruel and accusatory.  The negative stigmas that surround mental illnesses encourage silence and seeking professional help is perceived to be a weakness.""GIVING UP IS NEVER AN OPTION.""This podcast will provide the mental health sufferer or their family with insight, tools for survival and ""real-life"" stories that will teach techniques and ways to stay positive.My websites:https://www.throughtheeyesofdepression.org"

America was not yet America, but this was the moment it began. No aspect of the country that would be formed here has been untouched by the 250 years of slavery that followed. On the 400th anniversary of this fateful moment, it is time to tell the story.
“1619” is a New York Times audio series hosted by Nikole Hannah-Jones. You can find more information about it at nytimes.com/1619podcast."

https://www.fearfreechildbirth.com/feed	Fear Free Childbirth	"The Fear Free Childbirth podcast is for parents-to-be who want a positive and fear-free birth experience. Many pregnant women credit the podcast with helping them have a positive birth. <br />
<br />
The show is a mix of real life positive birth stories, birthing experts sharing their wisdom and Alexia sharing how to get into a positive birthing mindset, including techniques for releasing fears. <br />
<br />
Alexia is a therapeutic coach, speaker, trainer and author of the book “Fearless Birthing: Clear Your Fears For a Positive Birth”. The podcast, which began as a maternity leave side project, is now an essential resource for women with a fear of birth with tens of thousands of expectant mamas now listening to Alexia’s podcast each month to lose The Fear and prepare for birth.  <br />
<br />
It all started when Alexia experienced her first miscarriage and felt relief; she knew something was amiss. She had tokophobia, the extreme fear of pregnancy and birth, which is pretty terrifying. Alexia used her superpowers to overcome it and have two amazing births, and she now helps other women all around the world to do the same from her home in the middle of England. <br />
Fear Free Childbirth is the online destination for women seeking to take the fear out of birth with fear-clearance meditations, online fear-clearance courses and programs for overcoming tokophobia. Find out more at FearFreeChildbirth.com and Fearless-Birthing.com<br />"

One area that we’ll discuss weekly are new all age comic books. Every week dozens of new all age comics are released and we’ll mention all of them in addition to highlighting the ones we like the best. <br />
Books! Children’s books can be like tribbles on the Enterprise. In a separate podcast we’ll highlight the books that we’ve gotten recently and which ones really shine.  Because life it too short to not spend it with a good book, especially when your audience has the attention span of a gnat."
